# Developer Api - Postman Collection
A postman collection to get you up and running with Capital One UK's Developer API at lightspeed! 

## Getting An Access Token 
1. Head over to https://developer.capitalone.co.uk/hackathon and follow the four simple instructions to get your login token - starting by logging in with your GitHub account! 
2. You're going to need a Hackathon Passphrase. This will be shared at the hackathon you're attending - ask one of the Capital One reps to share it with you! This will let you access your unique JWT currently: `bark-closely-meet-company`. Use this to obtain your unique login code!
3. Once you've reached the profile page - you'll be provided with your unique access code!

## Installing The Postman Collection
1. Download this repository to your local machine!
2. Head over to https://www.postman.com/downloads/ and either download the client - or log-in via the web.
3. Once you're up and running with postman - choose the "Import" option.
4. Drag and drop the collection into the import window.

## Adding Environment Variables
1. Remember the unique access code we provided you with earlier? You now need to store this in the `authJwt` environment variable. To do this head to the icon shaped like an eye in the top right hand corner of the window. Select edit and paste your authentication code into the table.

# You should now have everything you need to start working with Developer API. Happy Hackathon'ing!
